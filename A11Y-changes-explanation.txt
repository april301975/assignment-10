For the archery site, changed light blue from #03a3df (from provided color palette)
to #18BFFB to change contrast from 3.38 to 4.58
For the Kitties site, change the nav text from #808080 to #595959 to increase from 2.64 to 4.69

I added tabindex for the webforms in the archery site to tab through the long form.

For both sites, I changed "alt" and and added "title" to text that are much more descriptive

For the kitties site, I changed "Book Now" to "Reserve your Cat of The Week" because "A link should explain clearly what information the reader will get by clicking on that link"
ALSO, changed "Find out more" to "Find out more about Cat in The News"
